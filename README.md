## About

When submitting pull requests to a component of Cloud Foundry
non-Pivotal employees are required to submit a CLA in order to have
their code merged.

This bot watches for incoming pull requests and checks to see if the
author has signed a CLA. If they have then it does nothing and goes on
its merry way. If they have not then it comments on the pull request to
let the author know what they have to do.

## Usage

1. Copy `config/config.example.yml` to `config/config.yml`.
2. Modify the options (GitHub credentials for the commenter, callback
   URL, users to not comment on, and repositories to watch) in that file
   to taste.
3. Push the application to your favourite application hosting service.
4. Rest easy knowing that Judge Dredd is figting your legal battles for
   you.
